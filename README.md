# VR-Maze-Game
## Description
This is a Unity VR project created by the CARVR software team in collaboration with the design team. In this game, you can explore a dungeon maze in VR, solve puzzles to get from room to room, and interact with other objects throughout the game to do various different things. We started this project in the fall of 2023, and are presently still working on it.

## Device Compatability & Set-up
We recommend playing this project using the Oculus Quest Link. Instructions on how to set up Quest Link can be found at [this link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/).

This game was made and tested using Quest Link with headsets such as the Meta Quest 2 and the Meta Quest 3. It has not been thoroughly tested with other headsets to ensure functionality across devices, but you're welcome to try it out on other devices nonetheless.

## Current Scenes & Development
As of right now, there exist a wide variety of scenes in this Unity project. They are all organized in a single "Scenes" folder with a couple subfolders. You can check out the current levels in the "Levels" subfolder, or check out some of test scenes in other subfolders.

Here is a video of the first level as of 2/3/2024:

## Potential Future Plans
This is a work-in-progress project, which we will likely continue to add to as time passes. Below are a list of some future ideas we may eventually include in this project.
- Monsters/enemies to fight with weapons
- Setting up the UI with a main menu screen to select levels
- Adding a health bar and death system
- More advanced player movement (sprinting, jumping, etc.)
- A scoring system based on monsters defeated and time taken
- Food and health power ups
- Puzzles and other side interactions
- Procedurally generated levels
