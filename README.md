# VR-Maze-Game
## Description
This is a project created by the CARVR software team in collaboration with the design team. In this game, you can explore a dungeon maze in VR, solve puzzles to get from room to room, and interact with other objects throughout the game to do various different things.

## Device Compatability
This game was made and tested using quest link with headsets such as the Meta Quest 2 and the Meta Quest 3. It has not been thoroughly tested with other headsets to ensure functionality across devices, but you're welcome to try it out anyway.

## Device Set-up
We recommend playing this project using the Oculus Quest Link. Instructions on how to set up Quest Link can be found at [this link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/).

## Potential Future Plans
This is a work-in-progress project, which we will likely continue to add to as time passes. Below are a list of some future ideas we may eventually include in this project.
- Monsters/enemies to fight with weapons
- Setting up the UI with a main menu screen to select levels
- Adding a health bar and death systme
- More advanced player movement (sprinting, jumping, etc.)
- A scoring system based on monsters defeated and time taken
- Food and health power ups
- Puzzles and other side interactions
- Procedurally generated levels
